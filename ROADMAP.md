# Roadmap

This repository is built as a **21-phase promptbook-driven project** (Phase 0
through Phase 17, split fix/delete cycles 18A/18B, and a Final release
phase). Each phase is scoped to be independently completable, testable, and
documented before the next begins. Phases are not sprints with fixed dates —
they are ordered units of work. A phase is not "done" until its required
tests pass (see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the per-phase
process).

This file tracks the *plan*. Day-to-day open issues live in
[`problems_master.md`](problems_master.md). The exact phase prompts this
roadmap follows come from the private planning document that seeded this
project; the table below is the authoritative phase order and scope for this
repository going forward.

## Phase index

| Phase | Theme | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Repository operating rules, architecture, conventions, ADRs, scaffolding | **Complete** |
| 1 | Synthetic healthcare data estate across 5 heterogeneous source systems | **Complete** |

| 3 | Enterprise deterministic masking engine (pseudonymization/tokenization) | Not started |
| 4 | Referentially intact, production-scale data subsetting | Not started |
| 5 | Synthetic test data generation (scenario/edge-case data) | Not started |
| 6 | Certified test dataset pipeline (ingest→...→certify→publish) | Not started |
| 7 | Dataset lifecycle and refresh management (versions, cadence, retention) | Not started |
| 8 | Storage and compute footprint management / capacity planning | Not started |
| 9 | React/TypeScript enterprise TDM web console | Not started |
| 10 | Centralized enterprise masking standard (multi-business-unit governance) | Not started |
| 11 | Platform integrity (health, resiliency, failure injection) | Not started |
| 12 | Production CI/CD and cloud testing (GitHub Actions, K8s, Terraform) | Not started |
| 13 | Auditability and compliance evidence | Not started |
| 14 | Scale and performance engineering (PySpark benchmarks) | Not started |
| 15 | Complete junior-engineer tutorial (20 chapters) | Not started |
| 16 | Interview / system design documentation | Not started |
| 17 | Principal-engineer production readiness review (findings only, no fixes) | Not started |
| 18A | Fix/delete cycle for P0/P1 findings from Phase 17 | Not started |
| 18B | Fix/delete cycle for P2/P3 findings from Phase 17 | Not started |
| Final | Recruiter/interviewer-ready release (README rewrite, demo, checklist) | Not started |

## Phase 1 — what was actually delivered

- A completely synthetic, multi-system healthcare data estate: Member,
  MemberDemographics, Address, Coverage, Plan, Provider, Claim, ClaimLine,
  Diagnosis, Procedure, Prescription, Pharmacy, Encounter, LabResult
- Distributed across 5 simulated heterogeneous sources: PostgreSQL-shaped
  (SQLAlchemy models), Parquet object storage, S3-compatible NDJSON,
  Azure/ADLS-compatible CSV, and an external partner file/API feed
- 4 configurable scale profiles (tiny/developer/qa/performance) and required
  edge cases (nulls, duplicates, orphans, malformed values, late-arriving
  data, schema drift), each guaranteed present and covered by tests
- See `services/data-plane/src/data_plane/reference_data/README.md` and
  `docs/tutorial/02-synthetic-data-estate.md` for details

## Phase 0 — what was actually delivered

- Repository structure across six architectural planes
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` describing the system, its planes, and their interfaces
- ADRs recording the foundational technical decisions (`docs/adr/`)
- `SECURITY.md`, `THREAT_MODEL.md`, `DATA_GOVERNANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/tutorial/`, `docs/runbooks/`, `docs/diagrams/` seeded with real content
- `problems_master.md` established as the live problem-tracking process
- Empty/scaffold Python packages for `control-plane`, `data-plane`,
  `governance-service`, and the shared `contracts` library, each with a
  `pyproject.toml` and a documented purpose but no business logic
- Empty/scaffold React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
- Docker Compose, Terraform, and Helm scaffolding (structure only, not wired
  to real infrastructure yet)
- GitHub Actions CI workflow skeleton

## Non-goals for Phase 0

- No working application. Nothing here should be expected to run end to end.
- No real database migrations, no real masking logic, no real UI screens.
- No dependency installation was run (`pip install` / `npm install`) — config
  files are in place so a later phase can do this deliberately, once there is
  something worth installing dependencies for.
